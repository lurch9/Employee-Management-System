# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## Your Task

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. The objective is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.



## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```


## Mock-Up

The following video shows an example of the app being used in command line.
